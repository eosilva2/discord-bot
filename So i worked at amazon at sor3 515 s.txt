So i worked at amazon at sor3 515 schmeer rd portland oregon. i started as an assosiate in november 17 2022 and got promoted to process assistant in july 30 2023. . my tenure was 2 year, 9 monhts and 8 days and time in PA level was 2 years and 26 days.

my name is Eduardo SIlva.  I dont wan tto put my education on my resume. 
I first started amazon as an assosiate in a new building that just launched. became an ambassador within 3 months of working there. as an ambassador  i would onboard new hires, give day one presentation, show them around the building and train them in all process paths during hteir first month. A challenging success story during my time as an ambassador is ttaht when i first got trained i shadowed somone how to do a class 1 time and the next day got told by my operations manager that If i was ready to do a class on my own for 25 people in 3 days (the standard is 5 people per 1 ambassador) me not wanting to dissapoint my bosses belief in me said yeah of course. I had 3 days to create my own version of the welcome presenteation and site tour and did it flawlessly. my boss congradulated me for a class well done and said he believed I could be a proccess assistant with my level of dedication and proactiveness. 
During that time as an ambassador my managers started prepping me to be a Process assistatnt. i was trained in every role including critical roles, oppening trailesr and even checking in drivers and ensureing we werew loading and unloading the right trailers. i was even taught to staff accordingly to meet goals. when the time came to apply for PA, I got told directly from the hirring manager to apply I did and got rejected
